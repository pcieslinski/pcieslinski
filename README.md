## Hi there 👋

I’m a Python Developer with a very unusual set of skills and experience. During my career,
I had the opportunity to participate in the process of producing software solutions from the business
side as Product Manager, technical as Python Developer, and UX as Designer. It gave me a great 
understanding of how comprehensive and complex problems in the IT industry can be.

As an engineer, I try to remember that even the most sophisticated tech solution won't be effective 
unless the users feel that it fixes real problems.
