## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a very unusual set of skills and experience. During my business career, I had the opportunity to participate in the process of producing software solutions from different perspectives - as a Product Manager, UX Designer, and Software Developer. It gave me a great understanding of how comprehensive and complex problems in the IT industry can be. As an engineer, I try to remember that even the most sophisticated tech solution won't be effective unless the users feel that it fixes real problems. 

I have had the opportunity to work with various technologies: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript. I am trying to become a polyglot programmer, currently developing my Golang skills.

One of my greatest passions is crypto and Web 3.0. I strongly believe that those are the innovations that will change the way people live, organize and interact.
